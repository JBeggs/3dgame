### 3D Game Skeleton

Commands:

Client
```
cd client
npm i
npm run dev
```

Server
```
cd server
npm i
npm run start
```

Open the client dev server URL that Vite prints (default `http://localhost:5173`).
To access from other devices on your LAN, the dev server now binds to 0.0.0.0; use `http://<your-ip>:5173`.

Extras
- MiniMap (bottom-right) shows the dungeon layout and player dot
