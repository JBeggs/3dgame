### 3D Game Development Plan (React WebView)

This plan resets the project for a lean, modern 3D game that runs inside a React WebView. It satisfies all 13 requirements with an under-10MB-on-first-load budget and leaves room for growth via lazy-loading.

### Goals and Constraints
- **3D**: Third‑person, lightweight visuals, stylized low‑poly art for performance.
- **Detailed avatar**: Modular glTF avatar with equipable parts and color/material swaps.
- **React WebView**: Embed as a React component; export a clean API to the host app.
- **Good 3D engine + map generator**: Three.js + procedural dungeon/room generator with decorator passes.
- **Under 10 MB initial download**: Strict bundle and asset budgets; everything else lazy‑loaded.
- **Modern practices**: WebGL2 now, optional WebGPU path later; KTX2/Draco/meshopt; ECS; client prediction/interp.
- **Multiplayer**: Lightweight authoritative Node server over WebSocket.
- **Fast**: 60 FPS target on mid phones; frame budgets enforced.
- **Gameplay**: Collect items, unlock doors, fight simple AI creatures.
- **Avatar selection/dress‑up**: Menu to pick body, head, outfit, colors, accessories.
- **Easy map updates**: Seeded procedural generation + small JSON map descriptors; hot‑reload.

### Tech Stack (choices made for size, speed, ecosystem)
- **Engine/Renderer**: Three.js (ESM). Core ~0.6MB min+gz.
- **React integration**: react-three-fiber (R3F) + @react-three/drei (selective imports). R3F ~40KB gz; Drei used sparingly.
- **Physics**: cannon-es (≈300KB min). Good enough for simple collisions, rigid bodies, triggers.
- **ECS**: tiny-ecs or BiteCS (both <50KB). Prefer BiteCS for perf.
- **Pathfinding/AI**: Yuka (steering + FSM) with grid/navmesh made from generator (loaded as JSON).
- **Procedural generation**: BSP + tunneling for rooms/corridors; Poisson‑disk props; Perlin cellular variations.
- **Asset formats**: glTF 2.0 with Draco + Meshopt; textures in KTX2 (BasisU). Texture atlases to reduce requests.
- **Networking**: Node 20 server with ws; state snapshots at 20Hz + client prediction and interpolation.
- **Build tooling**: Vite + Rollup code‑splitting; dynamic imports for editor/optional features.

### Size Budget (first meaningful play under 10 MB)
- Code (client, excluding maps/assets): ≤ 2.5 MB gz.
- Three.js core + R3F: ≤ 0.8 MB gz.
- Physics + ECS + AI libs: ≤ 0.5 MB gz total.
- Initial assets (1 map tileset, 1 modular avatar base, UI): ≤ 5 MB gz using Draco+KTX2.
- Audio: streamed or lazy‑loaded (≤ 1 MB intro SFX total).
- Everything else lazy‑loaded per map/creature.

### High‑Level Architecture
- **ECS**: Components for Transform, Renderable, PhysicsBody, Controller, Health, Inventory, Interactable, Door, AI.
- **Systems**: Input, Movement (client prediction), Physics step, Combat, Interact, AI, Animation, Networking (send/recv), Rendering, UI.
- **Authoritative server**: Validates actions (attacks, pickups, doors). Clients predict movement; server corrects with time‑stamped snapshots.
- **Map pipeline**: Generator → scene graph (tiles/rooms) → nav grid + simplified navmesh JSON → server/client share same seed.

### Map Generator Design (detail)
1. **Seeded BSP rooms** with variable sizes, tags (room, corridor, lair, treasure).
2. **Corridor carving** via Manhattan tunneling; optional stairs/verticality stubs.
3. **Decorator passes**:
   - Place doors at room thresholds; lock states bound to key items.
   - Scatter props and collectibles using Poisson‑disk sampling and tag rules.
   - Spawn points for creatures based on room tags and difficulty curve.
4. **Nav data output**: grid (byte array) + simplified navmesh polygons for AI.
5. **Serialization**: tiny JSON (<50KB) storing seed, rules, and deltas for manual edits.

### Avatar System
- **Modular avatar**: base body + head + hair + outfit + accessory; each piece is a separate glTF with shared skeleton.
- **Dress‑up**: swap meshes/material variants; color tints via uniforms; optional decals.
- **Animation**: Idle/walk/run/attack/hit; retargeted to shared rig. Use GLTFAnimation with cross‑fades.
- **Selection**: React UI panel; persists in localStorage; server stores cosmetic IDs only.

### Creatures and Combat
- **MVP enemies**: Spider, Bat, Slime. Low‑poly models with 1–2 animations.
- **AI**: Yuka steering (seek, wander, flee) + finite state machine (Idle → Patrol → Chase → Attack → Flee/Die).
- **Combat**: Simple hit‑scan/melee overlap tests via physics triggers; invulnerability frames; knockback.

### Interactions
- **Collect items**: trigger volumes with UI prompt; server confirms pickup; inventory component updated.
- **Open doors**: interact key — checks inventory or kill‑count; animates door; updates nav data locally.
- **Room progression**: Unlock sequence spawns next room set; optional boss gate.

### React WebView Integration
- Export `<GameCanvas />` component with props:
  - `onReady(api)` returns control API (pause, resume, loadMap, setAvatar, joinMatch, leaveMatch).
  - `options` for quality, input, audio, server URL.
- No global state leakage; runs in a single canvas; resizes to container.

### Performance & Modern Practices
- WebGL2 renderer now; progressive upgrade path to WebGPU when broadly available.
- KTX2 textures, Draco+Meshopt compressed glTF; texture atlas + instancing for props.
- Deterministic fixed‑timestep physics; decoupled render at vsync.
- GPU profiling overlays for dev; production disables logs.
- Mobile controls (virtual stick + buttons); low/medium/high presets.

### Multiplayer Synopsis
- **Server**: Node/ws; ECS mirror for authoritative state; tick at 20Hz; delta‑compressed snapshots.
- **Client netcode**: input samples with timestamps; prediction; interpolation buffer ~100ms; server reconciliation.
- **Rooms/matches**: basic lobby → match room; cap 8 players for MVP.

### Build & Asset Pipeline
- Vite code‑splitting; only core loads initially; editor/extra enemies lazy‑load.
- glTF pipeline: `gltf-transform` (prune, dedup, draco, meshopt) + `toktx` to make `.ktx2` textures.
- Texture budgets: 512–1024px for environment; 256–512px for characters; PBR but simplified.
- Audio: Ogg/Vorbis mono, short loops; stream longer music.

### Testing & Metrics
- Headless server sim tests for movement/combat determinism.
- FPS, frame‑time percentiles, memory caps recorded to console in dev.
- Playwright smoke test for WebView mount and first interaction.
